Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.

Example 1:

Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"


class Solution(object):
    def multiply(self, num1, num2):
        """
        :type num1: str
        :type num2: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        num1=int(num1)
        num2=int(num2)
        return str(num1*num2)
